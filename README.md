# ttfx

Terminal text effects as a single static binary. Pipe text in, pick an effect:

```sh
ls -la | ttfx decrypt
cat banner.txt | ttfx beams
fortune | ttfx --random-effect
git log --oneline -10 | ttfx matrix
```

## Credit where it's due

**This is a port of [TerminalTextEffects](https://github.com/ChrisBuilds/terminaltexteffects)
(TTE) by [ChrisBuilds](https://github.com/ChrisBuilds).** Every effect, the animation engine,
and the command-line interface are their design — this project translates that work to Rust
and adds nothing of its own to the art. If you like what you see here, star the original.

TTE is MIT licensed and so is this port; the original copyright is preserved in
[LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE](NOTICE). Please file *effect* ideas upstream, where they belong.

## Why a port

TTE is a Python package. That's the right call for a library, but for a shell toy that lives in
your prompt pipeline it means an interpreter, an install step, and ~65 ms of import before the
first frame. ttfx is one dependency-free binary that starts in under a millisecond.

That difference is the whole reason this exists, and it compounds: once running, ttfx renders
every effect hundreds of times faster than Python TTE. Time to render each whole animation at
200×50 cells (46 lines of 190 characters), pacing disabled so this measures throughput rather
than `sleep()`:

| wipe | 138 | 1,346 ms | 2.4 ms | **552×** |

**ttfx is 423× faster than Python TTE** (geometric mean over the 35 effects that run to
completion; median 439×, range 174×–1,387×). Starting up to draw a single character takes 0.8 ms
against 66 ms.

¹ `matrix` and `thunderstorm` run for a fixed wall-clock duration, so Python and ttfx finish at the
same moment; what ttfx buys there is a far higher frame rate inside that window.

Measured on an AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX with ttfx 0.5.0 against TerminalTextEffects 0.15.0 on CPython
3.14.7, both pinned to two cores, output to `/dev/null`: ttfx best of five runs, Python best of
two. Reproduce it with `tools/fx/speed.py --python` (see `tools/fx/speed.py --help` for installing
Python TTE).

For energy rather than speed, `python3 tools/tests/bench_energy.py [effect ...]` reports the
joules one paced run costs, read from the CPU's RAPL counters (Linux, needs root to read them).

## The effects

All 37, each animating the Omarchy logo. Every frame below came out of the Rust binary — and is
byte-identical to what the Python original produces from the same input and seed.

Every effect takes its own options — `ttfx <effect> --help`. A few of the GIFs above shorten a
timed phase so the loop stays watchable (`matrix --rain-time 3`, `thunderstorm --storm-time 3`,
`vhstape --total-glitch-time 250`, `spotlights --search-duration 80`, `errorcorrect
--error-pairs 0.5`); everything else is stock.

## Fidelity

This is a *parity port*, not a reimplementation-in-spirit. Given the same input, config, and
random draws, ttfx produces **byte-identical frames** to the Python original — verified
mechanically in CI against a pinned upstream checkout (v0.15.0), not by eyeballing.

| Suite | Checks | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/parity/run_suite.sh` | 354 | every effect's frame stream, byte for byte, across configs and seeds |
| `tools/parity/tty_compare.sh` | 41 | the full terminal byte stream — canvas prep, cursor moves, teardown |
| `tools/tests/cli_corpus.sh` | 19 | exit codes and stdout/stderr routing |
| `tools/tests/*_behavior.py` | pty | what only a real terminal shows: resize restarts, signal teardown |
| `cargo test` | goldens + traces | easing/geometry/gradient values and engine state machines |

`./bin/test` runs these suites. CI also checks the FX engine as described below.

Making that possible meant reproducing upstream's quirks deliberately, not "fixing" them:
Python's banker's rounding, gradients built from integer floor division rather than float
interpolation, a bezier arc-length approximation that drops its final segment, and looping
scenes that report themselves complete on every tick. They're catalogued in
[`plan.md`](plan.md); the places where Python's unordered iteration had to be pinned down are
in [`docs/ordering-inventory.md`](docs/ordering-inventory.md).

**Two deliberate differences.** Random number generation is not bit-compatible with CPython —
ttfx uses xoshiro256++, so `--seed` is reproducible within ttfx but won't match Python's
Mersenne Twister. (The parity harness swaps a shared PRNG into both sides, which is what makes
frame comparison possible at all.) And Python plugin effects aren't supported, since there's
no interpreter to load them.

## Usage

```
<producer> | ttfx [terminal options] <effect> [effect options]

ttfx --help                 # all 37 effects and the terminal options
ttfx <effect> --help        # options for one effect
ttfx --random-effect        # surprise me (--include-effects / --exclude-effects to filter)
ttfx --print-completion bash|zsh
```

Terminal options (canvas size and anchoring, color handling, frame rate, text wrapping) go
before the effect name; effect options after it. Option names and defaults match `tte`, so
existing invocations work with the binary name swapped.

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl   # static, ~3.3 MB
```

`./bin/test` runs the core test and reference-parity suites. It needs python3, and
the parity half needs a copy of upstream, which it clones at the pinned commit on
first run:

```sh
./tools/parity/fetch_reference.sh   # what bin/test calls; safe to run by hand
```

Upstream is not vendored here — the harness fetches it, because it's their code.

CI also compares every effect with the original Rust engine using the native SIMD
choices and an emulated older x86-64 CPU. Each native choice is split across four
CI jobs. The ordinary test/build jobs and small CI policy/oracle harness tests run
on every PR update, including drafts. The full FX comparisons run for ready PRs
and pushes to `main`/`master` with changes outside documentation. Only root
Markdown files, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and `docs/` are treated as documentation;
code, dependencies, build configuration, test changes, and unknown paths trigger
the full suite. The decision uses the whole PR diff, so a documentation follow-up
cannot hide an earlier code change.

Marking a PR ready starts the full checks; returning it to draft skips them.
New PR updates cancel superseded runs. Maintainers can also use **Actions → CI →
Run workflow** to request the full suite regardless of changed files. There is no
nightly schedule. For merge enforcement, configure branch protection to require
**FX checks**, along with the ordinary checks: this stable job accepts intentional
skips but fails if the policy/harness tests fail or a required comparison does not
succeed. The workflow alone does not change repository branch protection.

Run the same checks locally with:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked
python3 tools/tests/fx_oracle_harness.py
python3 tools/tests/fx_ci_policy.py
JOBS=2 tools/fx/oracle-simd.sh quick
JOBS=2 tools/fx/qemu-oracle.sh qemu64
```

To run just one native setting, append `widest`, `no-avx512`, or `no-avx2` to
`tools/fx/oracle-simd.sh quick`. CI splits each setting across four disjoint
effect groups; use `ORACLE_SHARD=1/4` (then `2/4`, `3/4`, and `4/4`) to reproduce them.
Without that variable the script runs every effect. Results stream as each
effect finishes.

The native checks need Bash and python3. The emulated check additionally needs
`qemu-x86_64` (`sudo apt-get install qemu-user` on Ubuntu). Both compare complete
stdout, stderr, and exit status. Native runs cover the default configuration,
`TTFX_NO_AVX512=1`, and both `TTFX_NO_AVX512=1`/`TTFX_NO_AVX2=1`. These overrides
exercise the narrower motion and RNG paths; the renderer still detects the host
CPU independently. Native CI cannot exercise AVX-512 on runners without it.
The qemu64 run checks the baseline CPU path, including the renderer, and requires
fx to handle each case successfully; a fallback, matching errors, or an
incomplete effect suite fails the check.

## Scope

Linux and macOS. Built for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) originally; nothing targets a
specific libc, and CI runs the tests and CLI corpus on both platforms. The byte-exact
parity suites stay pinned to Linux/glibc — Apple's libm rounds a few transcendentals a
last-ulp differently, which quantization hides in real frames but a bit-exact comparison
would surface.
